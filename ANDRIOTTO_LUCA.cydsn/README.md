# Assignment \#4

## Documentation

The TopDesign is including the information about the used HW and the choices made.
The code documentation is concentrated in two files: "states.h" and "states.c".
In particular "states.c" is reporting the whole involved state machine.
"states.h" is reporting the defines used globally.


## Assumptions
The Smart Lamp is switched off in the initialization phase.
This can be easily changed through the definition called "INITIAL\_STATE" from 'S' to 'B'.
To make the lamp work independently from the application's first command it's necessary to make the change just mentioned.
